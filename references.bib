  abstract = {Secret ciphers fascinate students and are an ideal subject with which to motivate them to study mathematics. Recent articles in the Mathematics Teacher, for example, have described how various types of ciphers can be taught to high school students to enhance their learning of statistics (Feltman 1979), matrices (Camp 1985), functions and their inverses (Reagan 1986), and remainder arithmetic (Meneeley 1981). Ciphering also offers interesting examples of how so-called ``pure'' mathematics can be applied to real-world problems (Hilton 1984).},

Today's prime concern is to keep secure the information of different channel and medium related to one's and to communicate securely, and to do so cryptography method is the sole key to it. This research paper will briefly lighten on the history of cryptography, basic definitions related to cryptography and some basic theorems to build different types of cryptography models. This research paper will propose few propositions based on solvability equation and will introduce a solvability series. From ancient time to now there are several cryptographic models are invented. This research paper will present a new type of complete model of cryptography with the help of a modified solvability proposition and solvability series, different from others.},
